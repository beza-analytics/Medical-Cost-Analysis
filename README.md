# Medical Cost Analysis (SQL · Python · Power BI)

## Overview
Analysis of healthcare charges using SQLite (SQL) and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), complemented by a Power BI report. Focus: key cost drivers including smoking status, BMI, and age.

## Highlights
- SQL aggregations: smoker, BMI category, age group, region, sex×smoker
- Python execution and descriptive statistics; CSV outputs for BI
- Power BI dashboard aligned to the SQL/Python cuts

## Quick Links
- Notebook: [notebooks/medical_cost_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/medical_cost_analysis.ipynb)  
- SQLite DB: [db/medical_cost.db](db/medical_cost.db)  
- Dashboard (PDF): [visuals/medical_cost_dashboard.pdf](visuals/medical_cost_dashboard.pdf)

## Executive Insights
- Smokers show substantially higher average charges than non-smokers
- Charges increase with BMI; obesity associates with elevated costs
- Charges rise with age; region and sex effects are smaller by comparison
